## Development environment

Project and package management is done using [rye]. For a good
introduction to rye, see the [postmodern python] blog post.

Use rye to add and remove dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
Development packages are added by applying the `--dev` flag:

    rye add package
    rye add dev-package --dev
    rye remove package
    rye remove dev-package --dev

After modifying dependencies, make sure to run `rye sync` to update
the virtual environment.

## Virtual environment

rye sets up a virtual environment in `.venv`. You should be able to
activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`. However, if
you have `pyenv` installed you may run into the issue that nothing
seems to load. This is a known issue (see [pyenv issue]). You can
always run programs in the virtual environment with `rye run`, e.g.,

    rye run pytest -v -s

## Linting and testing workflow

rye provides support for Python code formatting, linting, and more.
The steps can be run separately

    rye fmt
    rye lint --fix
    rye run check
    rye test

Alternatively, you can run the entire toolchain with

    rye run all

## Development with small test data set

Development is facilitated by loading the small data set that is
provided and reloading upon code changes:

    rye run python -m tseda tests/data/test.trees

The test data is a modified simulation of the [out of Africa]
demographic model (stdpopsim model `OutOfAfrica_3G09`), amended with
three outgroup species. The geolocations are dummy locations meant to
reflect typical metadata.

## Monitoring resource usage and user behaviour

The `--admin` option will activate the `/admin` panel:

    rye run python -m tseda tests/data/test.trees --admin

If the project is served locally on port 5006, the `/admin` endpoint
would be available at `http://localhost:5006/admin. See [admin] for
more information.

## Serving the application in development mode

For interactive development, you can serve the app in development mode
with `panel serve`:

    rye run panel serve src/tseda --dev --show --args tests/data/test.trees
